# Pokegame
A Pok√©mon clone that lacks graphics

This game is a Pokemon clone that is confined to output of the user's IDE. This is one of my first projects that was mainly meant to let me practice using python for the first time. I eventually want to develop graphics for the game with either tkinter or angular. The game is very simple and just is one of my first attempts at making something of my own.
